\title{Extragalactic Exoplanets -- Higher Cadence Observations of SMC}
\author{Rados\l{}aw Poleski and Przemek Mr\'oz}
\date{November 2018}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose to increase LSST cadence for the Small Magellanic Cloud which will 
enable finding dozens of microlensing events annually and potentially, a few 
planetary events over the course of the survey.  These would be 
the first extragalactic exoplanets ever discovered and will give us a unique constraint on 
the planet formation and evolution under different environments.  We discuss what changes in 
the LSST observing strategy are required.  Presented analysis takes into account 
an extensive photometric follow-up program.

The deep understanding of planet formation and evolution requires 
studying planets in a wide range of environments.  Currently known exoplanets 
are situated in the Milky Way and most of them are found close to the Sun 
because of higher sensitivity of transit and radial velocity techniques for 
brighter (hence nearby) host stars.  Discovering extragalactic exoplanets 
is even more challenging than finding the Milky Way planets because of 
larger distances.  High cadence observations of 
the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) by LSST will allow 
finding extragalactic exoplanets using gravitational microlensing 
technique.  

Microlensing is sensitive to the lens mass, not light, hence, 
allows finding very faint objects.  Microlensing searches of exoplanets toward M31 
have not yet found planets, mainly due too small number of events 
\citep{ingrosso09,calchinovati14,lee15}.  The other possibility of 
finding extragalacitc exoplanets with LSST --- transit method applied to LMC 
--- requires a dedicated Deep-drilling field 
(which is larger effort than proposed here) 
and candidate transit will be 
very difficult to confirm using even the next generation 30-m telescopes 
\citep{lund15,jacklin15}.  In \citet{mroz18b} we proposed to observe SMC with 
higher cadence, so that microlensing events can be found early and 
detection of planetary signatures in these events could be done using 
LSST data (if cadence is high enough) or using photometric follow-up 
observations from smaller telescopes.  SMC is elongated along the line-of-sight 
and the microlensing events 
observed toward SMC are almost exclusively self-lensing, i.e., 
both the lens and the source are in SMC \citep{sahu98,wyrzykowski11b}.  

There are thousands of microlensing events discovered so far toward 
the Galactic bulge.  Among these events, about 70 planetary events have 
already been published and more are being analyzed.  
% https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html
The planetary companion to the microlensing host star shows its presence via 
short-lasting anomaly \citep{mao91,gould92} ontop of 
a point-source point-lens event \citep{paczynski86}.  The length of 
the anomaly is on the order of Einstein timescale of the host event 
multiplied by a square root of the mass ratio.  Galactic bulge microlensing 
events have typical Einstein timescales of $\approx20~{\rm days}$, hence, 
giant planets produce signals that last on the order of 1~day.  
Current Galactic bulge microlensing surveys 
(mainly KMT, OGLE-IV, and MOA-II, but also Wise and UKIRT) 
have cadence of up to 15-20 minutes which allows robust detection of gas- and ice-giant 
exoplanets using survey data only \citep[e.g.,][]{yee12,poleski14c,shvartzvald16a}.  
The alternative approach is to follow-up events found by surveys with a network of 
follow-up telescopes which can have small field-of-view cameras and, 
in many cases, smaller apertures.  Follow-up observations are particularly useful for 
high-magnification events (peak magnification $\gtrsim100$), 
which both have higher planet detection efficiency and can be 
recognized in advance \citep{griest98,gould10}.  Median Einstein timescale for 
SMC events is $\approx3$ times longer than Galactic bulge events which leads to 
a longer timescales of anomalies.  One-hour cadence in the SMC should be enough 
to find high mass-ratio planets efficiently.  

The LSST telescope and camera have unique capability 
to study microlensing events toward SMC.  The photometry from the on-going 
microlensing surveys is not deep enough to allow finding large enough 
number of SMC events.  LSST field of view is large enough to cover almost 
whole region of interest in just a single pointing.

It is possible that planet frequency in the SMC is lower than in 
the Solar neighborhood.  The correlation between stellar metallicity 
and planet frequency is well known \citep{fischervalenti05,wang15}, 
but without performing proposed experiment we cannot be sure if 
it applies to smaller-mass hosts and wider orbit planets, which are probed 
by microlensing.  Below we present expected yield that assumes fiducial 
planet frequency rate and request the experiment with yield of a few planets 
so that, scientifically interesting upper limits on 
the planet frequency can be derived if no planet is detected.

%    \item What is the effect of a trade-off on the exposure time and number of visits (e.g. increasing the individual image depth but decreasing the overall number of visits)?
%    \item What is the effect of a trade-off between uniformity in number of visits and co-added depth? Is there any benefit to real-time exposure time optimization to obtain nearly constant single-visit limiting depth?

\section{Performance Evaluation}
%\begin{footnotesize}
%{\it Please describe how to evaluate the performance of a given survey in achieving your desired
%science goals, ideally as a heuristic tied directly to the observing strategy (e.g. number of visits obtained
%within a window of time with a specified set of filters) with a clear link to the resulting effect on science.
%More complex metrics which more directly evaluate science output (e.g. number of eclipsing binaries successfully
%identified as a result of a given survey) are also encouraged, preferably as a secondary metric.
%If possible, provide threshold values for these metrics at which point your proposed science would be unsuccessful 
%and where it reaches an ideal goal, or explain why this is not possible to quantify. While not necessary, 
%if you have already transformed this into a MAF metric, please add a link to the code (or a PR to

In our simulations of detection efficiency, 
we have included intensive photometric follow-up observations.  
The best follow-up would be uniform and 24-hour coverage of 
every on-going microlensing event with high photometric accuracy. 
SMC lies close to the South celestial pole and there is a limited number of 
observatories with good astronomical climate that can observe SMC.  
There is a large number of telescopes located in Chile, but they cover a narrow 
range of longitudes.  Outside Chile, the only observatories with large aperture telescopes are 
Siding Spring Observatory (Australia) and 
South African Astronomical Observatory (South Africa).  
The number of clear nights and seeing are better for Chilean observatories.  
Taking all these aspects into account, we divide follow-up observations 
into Chilean and non-Chilean.  
For Chilean observatories, we assume observations are taken when the SMC center 
is at the altitude $>30^{\circ}$ and Sun is at the altitude $<-15^{\circ}$ 
as seen from Cerro Pach\'{o}n.  We select nights for which these conditions 
are fulfilled for at least $30~{\rm min.}$ and assume uniform cadence of 
$1~{\rm h}$.  To simulate the impact of clouds, we remove epochs for which 
there is no LSST observations (in any field) $1~{\rm h}$ prior or after 
considered follow-up epoch.  There are in total ten optical telescopes 
in Chile that have aperture of $4~{\rm m}$ or larger.  
We assume that follow-up observations will be conducted 
using a $\approx4$-${\rm m}$ aperture telescope and the same exposure time as for LSST.  
The same accuracy should be achievable using longer (and still reasonable) 
exposure times on a 2-m class telescopes.  To account for airmass, seeing, and 
sky transparency on photometric accuracy, we use the accuracy of the closest LSST observation 
with additional correction of $\delta m_5 = -0.53~{\rm mag}$ added to $5\sigma$ depth of LSST 
(for this we use the $i$-band observations in a few fields close to SMC), see \citet{ivezic18}. 

The potential follow-up telescopes outside Chile have smaller apertures and 
poorer weather conditions.  We simulate these additional follow-up epochs 
assuming there is a single epoch per night and it is shifted by 12~h 
relative to observations in Chile.  Additionally, we select half of 
the nights only.  To obtain photometric accuracy of these data, we follow 
the same procedure as for Chilean follow-up observations.

For each event, the follow-up observations are assumed to start $12~{\rm h}$ 
after the event detection and end $3t_{\rm E}$ after the event peaks.

The above strategy leads to on average 1400 follow-up epochs for 
Chilean observatories over 10-month long season in {\tt baseline\_2018a} run. 
For non-Chilean observatories there are on average 120 follow-up 
epochs per season.
